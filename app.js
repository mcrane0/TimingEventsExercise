    inside the div with the id of "timeout-nesting" 2 seconds after the page loads. Also, below the "One" p 
    element/tag, have the text of "Two" also displayed as a p element/tag inside the same div 3 seconds after

    number at a time every second.
3b. Have the "STOP" button set up so that when it is pressed the setInterval method created in 3a will stop 
    continuously running (HINT: Need to create a variable).
