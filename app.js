/*
1. Use a setTimeout method to have "Hi" displayed as a p element/tag inside the div with the id of "first" 1 
    second after the page loads.
2. Use nested setTimeout methods to complete the following: Have the text of "One" displayed as a p element/tag 
    inside the div with the id of "timeout-nesting" 2 seconds after the page loads. Also, below the "One" p 
    element/tag, have the text of "Two" also displayed as a p element/tag inside the same div 3 seconds after 
    the page loads.
3a.  Use a setInterval method to display a counter in the console that starts at 1 and continues going up one 
    number at a time every second.
3b. Have the "STOP" button set up so that when it is pressed the setInterval method created in 3a will stop 
    continuously running (HINT: Need to create a variable).

/*
4. Using setInterval, display a countdown clock as a p element/tag inside the div with the id of "countdown". 
    Have the countdown clock start at 2 minutes and count down. The countdown clock should display in the 
    following format (Example: 2:00 to start and 0:00 at end). ALSO, when the countdown timer hits zero have 
    it display a message sayingâ€¦ "TIME IS UP" instead of the clock (AKA 0:00).
